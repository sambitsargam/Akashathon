# AkashLink

**AkashLink** aims to seamlessly bridge traditional finance and the Akash Network, empowering users to easily access and utilize decentralized services through direct fiat payments.

## Vision

AkashLink strives to enhance the accessibility, usability, and adoption of the Akash Network by integrating a user-friendly fiat payment gateway. This system enables users to purchase and manage Akash Network services using traditional fiat currencies.

## Problem Description

AkashLink solves the complexity and accessibility barriers of transitioning from fiat currencies to blockchain networks by providing a user-friendly and secure fiat payment gateway integrated with the Akash Network.

## Features

- **Fiat Payment Integration**: Allows users to purchase AKT tokens using fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, GBP, etc.
- **Third-Party Services**: Utilizes Kado Money to convert fiat to Osmosis (OSMO) and Leap Bridge to convert OSMO to AKT tokens.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlined process for acquiring AKT tokens, including email confirmation and address verification.
- **Secure Transactions**: Ensures secure handling of user data and compliance with regulatory standards.

## How It Works

1. **Get Started with AkashLink**:
   - Users click "Get Started" on the AkashLink platform.
   - If users do not have AKT tokens, a popup button prompts them to "Buy Token Using Fiat Money."

2. **User Information Collection**:
   - Users provide their email address for confirmation.
   - Users enter their address details for verification and compliance purposes.

3. **Payment Process**:
   - AkashLink uses Kado Money as a third-party service provider to facilitate the conversion of fiat currency to Osmosis (OSMO).

4. **Token Conversion**:
   - The Osmosis (OSMO) is then converted into Akash Token (AKT) using the Leap Bridge service.
